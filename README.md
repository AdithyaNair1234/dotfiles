# I title this setup - Catpuccin Overdose.
You, dear reader, will not find difficulty in agreeing with this.

I am currently running Fedora SilverBlue with Hyprland on a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Pro. Feel free to clone this repo and modify as needed.

The earlier version of this setup was a largely gruvbox-focused setup. That's until I realized just how beautiful catpuccin looks... I think I went too far.

Ah well here's the list of apps being used.

- nvim (My text editor of choice, but you probably guessed that from the fact that I have a dotfiles repo)
- alacritty (My terminal of choice, I don't really care honestly (Although Alacritty does have a vi-mode which might come in handy someday?)
- zathura (Vi-based PDF viewer, with catpuccin theming)
- tmux (My terminal multiplexer, with catpuccin of course.)
- swww (My wallpaper picker currently, it is very annoying, doesn't open on startup, I need to get to fixing that.)
- hypr (My window manager of choice, it's got pretty animations and it's dynamic)
- swayidle, swaylock (Haven't gotten to work on this yet, but you can bet it's gonna be catpuccin based)
- swaync (A notification daemon that doesn't really need any setup)
- wallpaper (Folder of all the pictures I use as wallpapers)
- waybar (My bar of choice)
- wofi (My app menu of choice)
- zsh (My shell of choice, it has random features that just makes things easier over bash)
