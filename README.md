# I title this setup - Catpuccin Overdose.
You, dear reader, will not find difficulty in agreeing with this.

The earlier version of this setup was a largely gruvbox-focused setup. That's until I realized just how beautiful catpuccin looks... I think I went too far.

I am currently running Fedora with Hyprland on a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Pro.
